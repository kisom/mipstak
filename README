MIPSTAK

This is a MIPS64 assembly implementation of the Tak algorithm,
inspired by late night browsing on Nekochan. (Although, technically,
it's an implementation of the tarai algorithm.)  A C implementation
is included as a baseline.

The assembly is a bit inelegant, but I'm working on that ;). I don't
have command line parsing of arguments in the MIPS64 version; to
change the initial parameters, edit the three words starting at
the label "args".

On my Octane (dual 250 MHz R10K):

<siberia: ~/src/mipstak> $ make
cc -o ctak -O2 -pipe  -fPIC  -g -O0 -static tak.c
cc -o atak -g -O0 -static  -g -O0 -static tak.S
<siberia: ~/src/mipstak> $ time ./ctak 18 12 6
nruns: 63609
t: 7
elapsed: 11336 usec
elapsed: 0 sec
average: 11336 usec
    0m0.03s real     0m0.00s user     0m0.00s system
<siberia: ~/src/mipstak> $ time ./atak
tarai(x=18, y=12, z=6) = 7
    0m0.02s real     0m0.00s user     0m0.01s system
<siberia: ~/src/mipstak> $ 

That's all for now, folks.

Addendum: I wrote a bit about the process of writing this:
